Purpose of this Guide
The information in this guide will help you gain the knowledge necessary for design and development of APIs on Google Cloud's Apigee Edge platform. It will help you learn about API design and documentation best practices, as well as the features of the Apigee Edge platform.

API Engineer Certification
Please see the API Engineer Certification page for a description of the API Engineer Certification. The information referenced in this document will be useful if you intend to take the API Engineer Certification exam.

The certification exam will test your familiarity with and knowledge of topics related not only to the Apigee Edge platform, but also API design and documentation best practices. Google Cloud's Apigee team provides thought leadership about all of these topics via ebooks, videos, and blogs, as well as the documentation provided on our website. A study guide with a high-level list of topics can also be found on the certification page.

This community post describes the exam-taking process.

Apigee API Engineer Training
Apigee API Engineer training, whether taken via in-person developer bootcamps or the online Coursera training, will help you learn many of the topics you will need to know to develop on the Apigee Edge platform.

This training will also be useful if you intend to take the API Engineer certification. Your training will not include all topics that are tested on the Apigee API Engineer Certification exam. For example, your training may not contain Microgateway, OpenAPI Specification 2.0, and command line deployment concepts, as well as best practices learned from Apigee's eBooks, webcasts, and blogs.

Apigee API Program Excellence Course
The Apigee API Program Excellence e-learning course on Youtube teaches you about what is required to build a great API Program. This course teaches you what Apigee's Digital Engagement Lead team does, and is recommended for API Engineers who are interested in expanding beyond the technical aspects of API Management into the business and strategy aspects of API programs.

Topics
This document lists most of the important topics useful for an Apigee API Engineer, presenting links to the content with short descriptions. The information is organized by topic. At the end of this document is a List of Resources by Source, which will provide the same links organized by source. Note: Apigee API Engineer training will cover many of these topics, and some of the webcasts and eBooks will cover topics also explained in the online docs.
